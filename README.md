# Hack.Chat

[https://hack.chat/](https://hack.chat/) is a minimal, distraction-free, account-less, log-less, disappearing chat service that is easily deployable as your own service. The client comes bundled with LaTeX rendering provided by [https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX).

This is a backwards compatible continuation of the work by Andrew Belt [https://github.com/AndrewBelt/hack.chat](https://github.com/AndrewBelt/hack.chat). The server code has been updated to ES6 along with several new features- including new commands and hot-reload of the commands/protocol.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The following versions are __required__:

```
    node >= 8.10.0
    npm >= 5.7.1
```

An installation guide for you operating system can be found at: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

### Installing

First you will first need to clone this git, if you are unfamiliar with this processes read [https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/), or to clone with git:

```
git clone https://github.com/hack-chat/main.git
```

Once cloned, the server will need to be setup. Using your terminal:

```
cd main/server/
npm install
```

Or on a Windows machine with Yarn installed:

```
cd main/server/
yarn install
```

This will install the required packages to run hack.chat. Next it will need to be configured, again in your terminal:

```
node main.js
```

The configuration script will execute the initial server setup by requesting input. Follow the steps until it finishes:

```
Note: npm/yarn run config will re-run this utility.

You will now be asked for the following:
-     Admin Name, the initial admin username
-     Admin Pass, the initial admin password
-           Port, the port for the websocket
-           Salt, the salt for username trip
â€‹
prompt: adminName:  admin
prompt: adminPass:  ****

prompt: websocketPort:  (6060)
prompt: tripSalt:  ************

Config generated! You may now start the server normally.
```

___Note:___ if you change the `websocketPort` option during the config setup then these changes will need to be reflected on line 64 of the [client.js](https://github.com/hack-chat/main/blob/master/client/client.js#L64).

After the config script runs, the process will exit & will need to be relaunched. For a production environment we recommend using [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) to start the server:

```
cd main/server/
pm2 start main.js --name HackChat
```

Launch `main/client/index.html`, you may now begin development or deploy to production environment.

## Deployment

After the initial installation and configuration, push everything except the node_modules folder to the live server and re-run:

```
npm install
```

You can now run start the server software with a process manager like [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2). The client code will need to be copied into your http server directory. If you plan on using SSL to serve the client; you will need to use a reverse proxy, as TLS is not natively supported by the hack.chat server software (this may change in future releases).
